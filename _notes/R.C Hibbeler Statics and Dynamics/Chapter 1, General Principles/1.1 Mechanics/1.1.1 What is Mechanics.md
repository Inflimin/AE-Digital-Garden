Core Question: "What is Mechanics"


>[!faq] Definition
>Mechanics, as the textbook states is a "branch of the physical sciences that is concerned with the state of rest or motion of bodies that are subjected to the action of forces"

>[!success] How I understand it
>Mechanics is a science that is concerned with how an object moves under the influence of a push or a pull, in other words, a force.

>[!note] Types of Mechanics
>Mechanics can be subdivided into three branches: 
>- **Rigid-body mechanics (objects with fixed shapes)** 
>- **Deformable-body mechanics (objects without fixed shapes)**
>- **Fluid mechanics (things like water and air, very important for AE)**
>
>>[!important] (Note that Hibbeler focuses on rigid-body mechanics as it acts as a pre-requisite for the other two branches.)

>[!summary] Summary
>Essentially, mechanics is defined as a study, which is why we are learning it right now, but more specifically on how objects move, like the state of motion they are in so to say, under the influence of a force like the earth's gravity for example! 
>
> This field is sub-categorized into three categories, rigid-body mechanics (mechanics of objects which are considered to have fixed-shapes), deformable-body mechanics (mechanics of objects which can be deformed, duh), and fluid mechanics (mechanics of more flowy things like air or water, will be clearly defined somewhere else (:)
