Core Question: "1.1.2 Rigid-Body Mechanics"

>[!faq] What exactly is rigid-body mechanics? 
>Rigid-body mechanics is a sub-field of mechanics, which deals with the motion of a "rigid-body" (basically an object that doesn't change shapes, will be defined better in later sections) under a "force" (will also be defined better in later sections), pretty simple right?
>> This is again, separated into two separate fields, which is why this book is also separated into two books, you guessed it! "Statics" and "Dynamics", now what in the heck do these terms mean?
>> 
>> >[!info] Statics! Equilibrium.
>> So well, statics basically deals with objects that are at rest (they don't move) or move with a constant velocity (they aren't accelerating). Well, what do these two have in common? They are in a state of "equilibrium", meaning all the forces (pushes and pulls) on them are all balanced, think of when you have like two clones of yourself playing tug of war and both of you are pulling on the rope with the same strength, the rope wouldn't move would it? This is because your strength balances your clone's strength out, and hence the rope is "at rest".
>> 
>>>[!warning] Wait...
>>Wait, but what about the constant velocity part? Well, think about it like this, if I want to drive in a car at a constant like, 60km/h for example, the car has to be in equilibrium for this to happen. AKA, the friction force and the force pumped out by the car's engine should cancel each other out, but this would mean the car isn't decelerating or accelerating right? So its technically, at rest...? But since it was already moving, it will stay at that speed until either the engine or the friction force wins and takes the lead, either accelerating or decelerating the car. Essentially, being at rest and at constant velocity doesn't really have that big of a difference, both being that the total force combined on the objects are all zero anyways, hence equilibrium and statics!
>>
>>>[!tip] Dynamics, in motion?
>>>Now, on the other hand, dynamics is concerned with objects which are accelerating or decelerating, basically uh, their acceleration is not zero, doesn't matter if its negative or positive, or in other words, their speeds are changing. So, technically, defining it like this, statics could technically be dynamics but just... zero acceleration. However, I guess this difference has to be made since a lot of things in engineering are designed with the intention to STAY at equilibrium, such as like, oh you know, a desk, or your laptop. Thank engineers your laptop isn't moving while you study.

>[!summary] Summary
>Basically, rigid-body mechanics is a specific field in mechanics that deals with the motion of fixed-shape objects (undeformable? basically), obviously this is an assumption, every object can be deformed in real life, but this is more of like a in the specific period of time kind of thing. Anyways, this is categorized into two forms, statics and dynamics, where statics deal with the rigid-bodies that are at rest or in constant velocity (acceleration is zero), and dynamics deal with the rigid-bodies that are changing in their velocity, (acceleration is not zero, so decelerating when acceleration is negative and accelerating when acceleration is positive)
